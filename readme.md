## Motivation

The idea for **HaloSatoshi** stemmed from frustration with the inefficiencies of online customer service (CS) systems in Indonesian banks. Often, bank websites lack comprehensive information, forcing users to contact CS even for general inquiries. This process is slow‚Äîusers must take a ticket, wait in a queue, and endure delays as CS agents think through responses. It‚Äôs highly inefficient and time-consuming.

**HaloSatoshi** aims to solve this by providing a 24/7 online CS chatbot for **Satoshi Bank**, delivering fast, accurate, and automated responses to customer queries and requests.
